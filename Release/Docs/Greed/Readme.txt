Usage: Make a profile first.  Copy the one here into Ashita/Config/Greed.xml if you want to use it as a base.

All of the settings nodes are the defaults, so uncomment them and change it if you want to change any of the settings.

The available click nodes are: lclick, rclick, mclick, button4, and button5.  All of them can be set up with the modifier attribute
with either ctrl or alt (NOT SHIFT), or both (in two separate attributes).

You can use any command that expects a target.  /ma <spell>, /ja <ability>, /target, /trade, whatever
